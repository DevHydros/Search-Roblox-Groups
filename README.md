# ðŸ˜ˆSearch-Roblox-GroupsðŸ˜ˆ
ðŸ˜ˆThis code will help you find roblox groups without an ownerðŸ˜ˆ

> [!WARNING]
> We recommend running the script as an administrator.

The code takes the random IDs of the roblox groups, and then checks:
* The group has an owner
* A group without an owner, but there is no way to join it
* Error
* A group without an owner and it is not allowed to join

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All groups that do not suit us are marked in red in the terminal, and the groups that do are marked in green.
>> If we still managed to find a group without an owner, it is created in the folder with our code. a txt document that will contain all the links of roblox groups suitable for us

`DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS = 10` - the number of seconds to check one group
> [!IMPORTANT]
>We do not recommend setting less than 10, because there will be errors due to the high number of API requests to the roblox website.
